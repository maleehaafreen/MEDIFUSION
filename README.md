# MEDIFUSION
**AI-Powered Healthcare Management System**
## 📌 About MediFusion  
MediFusion is a **MERN stack**-based healthcare management system designed to streamline medical appointments, medication reminders, and health alerts. It enhances patient care through AI-powered alerts and a secure review system.  
The Medicine Reminder App is a specialized application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js) that helps users manage and track their medication schedule effectively. The app's primary goal is to remind users to take their prescribed medications at the right time and ensure they adhere to their medical treatment plans.
The backend of the app, powered by Express.js and Node.js handles the server infrastructure and implements the logic for managing medicine reminders. MongoDB serves as the database, storing medication data. Mongoose is used to establish a connection to the MongoDB database and perform database operations.
The frontend is developed using React, providing a user-friendly interface for users to input their medication details and view their reminders. Users can enter medication names and the schedule for each medication. The app supports customizable reminder settings, allowing users to set specific times for each reminder.
To enhance medication adherence, the app can integrate with WhatsApp using the Twilio API. When a medication reminder is due, the app sends a WhatsApp notification to the user, reminding them to take their medication at the prescribed time. This feature ensures that users receive reminders directly on their smartphones, increasing the likelihood of timely medication intake.
By utilizing the MERN stack, MongoDB for data storage, and incorporating WhatsApp notifications, the Medicine Reminder App empowers users to manage their medication schedules effectively, ensuring they never miss a dose and facilitating better health outcomes.
